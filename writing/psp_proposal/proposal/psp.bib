@article{ohanley_restoring_2013,
	abstract = {Systematic methods for prioritizing the repair and removal of fish passage barriers, while growing of late, have hitherto focused almost exclusively on meeting the needs of migratory fish species (e.g., anadromous salmonids). An important but as of yet unaddressed issue is the development of new modeling approaches which are applicable to resident fish species habitat restoration programs. In this paper, we develop a budget constrained optimization model for deciding which barriers to repair or remove in order to maximize habitat availability for stream resident fish. Habitat availability at the local stream reach is determined based on the recently proposed C metric, which accounts for the amount, quality, distance and level of connectivity to different stream habitat types. We assess the computational performance of our model using geospatial barrier and stream data collected from the Pine-Popple Watershed, located in northeast Wisconsin (USA). The optimization model is found to be an efficient and practical decision support tool. Optimal solutions, which are useful in informing basin-wide restoration planning efforts, can be generated on average in only a few minutes.},

We analyze how the joint spatial distribution of costs and environmental benefits affect efficiency losses from following targeting rules based on cost or benefits, rather than based on the benefit to cost ratio. Using analytical and numerical models, we demonstrate that the relative variability of costs and benefits and the correlation between the two are primary determinants of efficiency losses. We apply our framework to renewal of Conservation Reserve Program contracts and estimate how well alternative targeting tools obtain environmental benefits under reduced budgets.},

@article{field_quantifying_2019,
	abstract = {The interdisciplinary nature of conservation problems is increasingly being incorporated into research, raising fundamental questions about the relative importance of the different types of knowledge and data. Although there has been extensive research on the development of methods and tools for conservation planning, especially spatial planning, comparatively little is known about the relative importance of ecological versus non-ecological data for prioritization, or the likely return on investment of incorporating better data. We demonstrate a simple approach for (1) quantifying the sensitivity of spatial planning results to different ecological and non-ecological data layers, and (2) estimating the potential gains in efficiency from incorporating additional data. Our case study involves spatial planning for coastal squeeze, a process by which development blocks coastal ecosystems from moving landward in response to sea-level rise. We show that incorporating spatial data on landowners' likelihood of selling had little effect on identifying relative priorities but drastically changed the outlook for whether conservation goals could be achieved. Better data on the costs of conservation actions had the greatest potential to improve the efficiency of spatial planning, in some cases generating more than an order of magnitude greater cost savings compared to ecological data. Our framework could be applied to other systems to guide the development of spatial planning and to identify general rules of thumb for the importance of alternative data sources for conservation problems in different socio-ecological contexts.},

@article{naidoo_integrating_2006,
	abstract = {Recent studies that incorporate the spatial distributions of biological benefits and economic costs in conservation planning have shown that limited budgets can achieve substantially larger biological gains than when planning ignores costs. Despite concern from donors about the effectiveness of conservation interventions, these increases in efficiency from incorporating costs into planning have not yet been widely recognized. Here, we focus on what these costs are, why they are important to consider, how they can be quantified and the benefits of their inclusion in priority setting. The most recent work in the field has examined the degree to which dynamics and threat affect the outcomes of conservation planning. We assess how costs fit into this new framework and consider prospects for integrating them into conservation planning.},

@article{roni_review_2002,
	abstract = {Millions of dollars are spent annually on watershed restoration and stream habitat improvement in the U.S. Pacific Northwest in an effort to increase fish populations. It is generally accepted that watershed restoration should focus on restoring natural processes that create and maintain habitat rather than manipulating instream habitats. However, most process-based restoration is site-specific, that is, conducted on a short stream reach. To synthesize site-specific techniques into a process-based watershed restoration strategy, we reviewed the effectiveness of various restoration techniques at improving fish habitat and developed a hierarchical strategy for prioritizing them. The hierarchical strategy we present is based on three elements: (1) principles of watershed processes, (2) protecting existing high-quality habitats, and (3) current knowledge of the effectiveness of specific techniques. Initially, efforts should focus on protecting areas with intact processes and high-quality habitat. Following a watershed assessment, we recommend that restoration focus on reconnecting isolated high-quality fish habitats, such as instream or off-channel habitats made inaccessible by culverts or other artificial obstructions. Once the connectivity of habitats within a basin has been restored, efforts should focus on restoring hydrologic, geologic (sediment delivery and routing), and riparian processes through road decommissioning and maintenance, exclusion of livestock, and restoration of riparian areas. Instream habitat enhancement (e.g., additions of wood, boulders, or nutrients) should be employed after restoring natural processes or where short-term improvements in habitat are needed (e.g., habitat for endangered species). Finally, existing research and monitoring is inadequate for all the techniques we reviewed, and additional, comprehensive physical and biological evaluations of most watershed restoration methods are needed.},

@article{king_toolkit_2017,
	abstract = {The presence of dams, stream--road crossings and other infrastructure often compromises the connectivity of rivers, leading to reduced fish abundance and diversity. The assessment and mitigation of river barriers is critical to the success of restoration efforts aimed at restoring river integrity. In this study, we present a combined modelling approach involving statistical regression methods and mixed integer linear programming to maximize resident fish species richness within a catchment through targeted barrier mitigation. Compared to existing approaches, our proposed method provides enhanced biological realism while avoiding the use of complex and computationally intensive population/ecosystem models. To estimate barrier passability quickly and at low cost, we further outline a rapid barrier assessment methodology. The methodology is used to characterize potential passage barriers for various fish species common to the UK but can be readily adapted to different planning areas and other species of interest. We demonstrate the applicability of our barrier assessment and prioritization approach based on a case study of the River Wey, located in south-east England. We find that significant increases in species richness can be achieved for modest investment in barrier mitigation. In particular, dams and weirs with low passability located on mid- to high-order streams are identified as top priorities for mitigation. Synthesis and applications. Our study shows the benefits of combining a coarse resolution barrier assessment methodology with state-of-the-art optimization modelling to cost-effectively plan fish passage barrier mitigation actions. The modelling approach can help inform on-the-ground river restoration decision-making by providing a recommended course of action that best allocates limited resources in order to restore longitudinal connectivity and maximize ecological gains.},

@article{milt_local-scale_2017,
	abstract = {Conservation planning aims to optimize outcomes for select species or ecosystems by directing resources toward high-return sites. The possibility that local benefits might be increased by directing resources beyond the focal area is rarely considered. We present a case study of restoring river connectivity for migratory fish of the Great Lakes Basin by removing dams and road crossings within municipal jurisdictions versus their broader watersheds. We found that greater river connectivity could often be achieved by considering both intra-jurisdictional and extra-jurisdictional barriers. Focusing on jurisdictional barriers alone generally forfeited {\textless}20\% (median = 0\%) of habitat gains for those who value solely habitat gains within the jurisdiction, but {\textgreater}75\% (median = 100\%) for planners who value larger-scale habitat gains. Similarly, cost savings tended to be between −50\% and +50\%, but in some cases were very negative. Our study underscores the local-scale benefits of broadening restoration investments, especially for decision makers of the Great Lakes Basin and contributes to a discussion of appropriate and efficient scales of conservation planning.

@article{elith_working_2008,
	abstract = {1 Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities and interactions. 2 This study provides a working guide to boosted regression trees (BRT), an ensemble method for fitting statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance). The final BRT model can be understood as an additive regression model in which individual terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion. 3 Boosted regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in BRT overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive performance. Although BRT models are complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior to most traditional modelling methods. 4 The unique features of BRT raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using BRT through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to enable the wider use of BRT by ecologists.},

@article{hermoso_accessible_2021,
	abstract = {Barriers associated to human infrastructure are a widespread impact in freshwater ecosystems worldwide, disrupting connectivity along river networks and key processes. Restoration of connectivity has risen in the last decade, with thousands of dams, weirs and culverts removed. Spatial optimisation methods can help inform decision on what barriers to remove to maximise gain in connectivity under limited budgets. However, current optimisation approaches rely on programming skills that are not easily accessible to stakeholders, which restrict the use of these methods. We demonstrate how Marxan, a publicly available tool, can be used to prioritise the allocation of barrier removal projects. We mapped the distribution of {\textgreater}900 barriers in the Tagus River (Iberian Peninsula) and 29 freshwater fish species with different movement abilities and needs. We assessed the passability of each barrier by all species and relative removal cost. We then identified priority barriers for removal to increase connectivity of populations of all species simultaneously. We tested two alternative scenarios: i) locking out barriers assesses as non-removable for their high strategic value or removal cost and ii) making all barriers available for removal. We found that connectivity recovery targets could be achieved by removing a small proportion of barriers, and avoiding large infrastructure. However, for some species, large recovery targets could only be achieved by removing some of these large infrastructures at high increases in cost. We also found some spatial differences in the recovery value of particular barriers for improving upstream and downstream connectivity. Our study demonstrates how to use a robust optimisation approach in an accessible tool, to address the complexity of prioritisation exercises commonly faced by stakeholders when deciding where to invest in barrier removal projects. This will improve decision-making for river connectivity restoration through a transparent, reproducible, and better-informed approach than traditional opportunistic or ranking-based approaches.},

	abstract = {In many large ecosystems, conservation projects are selected by a diverse set of actors operating independently at spatial scales ranging from local to international. Although small-scale decision making can leverage local expert knowledge, it also may be an inefficient means of achieving large-scale objectives if piecemeal efforts are poorly coordinated. Here, we assess the value of coordinating efforts in both space and time to maximize the restoration of aquatic ecosystem connectivity. Habitat fragmentation is a leading driver of declining biodiversity and ecosystem services in rivers worldwide, and we simultaneously evaluate optimal barrier removal strategies for 661 tributary rivers of the Laurentian Great Lakes, which are fragmented by at least 6,692 dams and 232,068 road crossings. We find that coordinating barrier removals across the entire basin is nine times more efficient at reconnecting fish to headwater breeding grounds than optimizing independently for each watershed. Similarly, a one-time pulse of restoration investment is up to 10 times more efficient than annual allocations totaling the same amount. Despite widespread emphasis on dams as key barriers in river networks, improving road culvert passability is also essential for efficiently restoring connectivity to the Great Lakes. Our results highlight the dramatic economic and ecological advantages of coordinating efforts in both space and time during restoration of large ecosystems.},

@article{burnett_distribution_2007,
	abstract = {The geographic distribution of stream reaches with potential to support high-quality habitat for salmonids has bearing on the actual status of habitats and populations over broad spatial extents. As part of the Coastal Landscape Analysis and Modeling Study (CLAMS), we examined how salmon-habitat potential was distributed relative to current and future (+100 years) landscape characteristics in the Coastal Province of Oregon, USA. The intrinsic potential to provide high-quality rearing habitat was modeled for juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and juvenile steelhead (O. mykiss) based on stream flow, valley constraint, and stream gradient. Land ownership, use, and cover were summarized for 100-m analysis buffers on either side of stream reaches with high intrinsic potential and in the overall area encompassing the buffers. Past management seems to have concentrated nonindustrial private ownership, agriculture, and developed uses adjacent to reaches with high intrinsic potential for coho salmon. Thus, of the area in coho salmon buffers, 45\% is either non-forested or recently logged, but only 10\% is in larger-diameter forests. For the area in steelhead buffers, 21\% is either non-forested or recently logged while 20\% is in larger-diameter forests. Older forests are most extensive on federal lands but are rare on private lands, highlighting the critical role for public lands in near-term salmon conservation. Agriculture and development are projected to remain focused near high-intrinsic-potential reaches for coho salmon, increasing the importance of effectively addressing nonpoint source pollution from these uses. Percentages of larger-diameter forests are expected to increase throughout the province, but the increase will be only half as much in coho salmon buffers as in steelhead buffers. Most of the increase is projected for public lands, where policies emphasize biodiversity protection. Results suggest that widespread recovery of coho salmon is unlikely unless habitat can be improved in high-intrinsic-potential reaches on private lands. Knowing where high-intrinsic-potential stream reaches occur relative to landscape characteristics can help in evaluating the current and future condition of freshwater habitat, explaining differences between species in population status and risk, and assessing the need for and feasibility of restoration.},

@article{barnas_is_2015,
	abstract = {Conservation and recovery plans for endangered species around the world, including the US Endangered Species Act (ESA), rely on habitat assessments for data, conclusions and planning of short and long-term management strategies. In the Pacific Northwest of the United States, hundreds of millions of dollars (\$US) per year are spent on thousands of restoration projects across the extent of ESA-listed Pacific salmon---often without clearly connecting restoration actions to ecosystem and population needs. Numerous decentralized administrative units select and fund projects based on agency/organization needs or availability of funds with little or no centralized planning nor post-project monitoring. The need therefore arises for metrics to identify whether ecosystem and species level restoration needs are being met by the assemblage of implemented projects. We reviewed habitat assessments and recovery plans to identify ecological needs and statistically compared these to the distribution of co-located restoration projects. We deployed two metrics at scales ranging from the sub-watershed to ESA listing units; one describes the unit scale match/mismatch between projects and ecological concerns, the other correlates ecological need with need treated by projects across units. Populations with more identified ecological concerns contained more restoration effort, but the frequency of ecological concerns in recovery plans did not correlate with their frequency as restoration targets. Instead, restoration projects were strongly biased towards less expensive types. Many ESA-listed salmon populations (78\%) had a good match between need and action noted in their recovery plan, but fewer (31\%) matched at the smaller sub-watershed scale. Further, a majority of sub-watersheds contained a suite of projects that matched ecological concerns no better, and often worse, than a random pick of all project types. These results suggest considerable room for gains in restoration funding and placement even in the absence of centralized planning. This analytical approach can be applied to any species for which habitat management is a principle tactic, and in particular can help improve efficiencies in matching identified needs with explicit management actions.},

	abstract = {Across the Pacific Northwest (PNW), both public and private agents are working to improve riverine habitat for a variety of reasons, including improving conditions for threatened and endangered salmon. These projects are moving forward with little or no knowledge of specific linkages between restoration actions and the responses of target species. Targeted effectiveness monitoring of these actions is required to redress this lack of mechanistic understanding, but such monitoring depends on detailed restoration information---that is, implementation monitoring. This article describes the process of assembling a database of restoration projects intended to improve stream and river habitat throughout the PNW. We designed the database specifically to address the needs of regional monitoring programs that evaluate the effectiveness of restoration actions. The database currently contains spatially referenced, project-level data on over 23,000 restoration actions initiated at over 35,000 locations in the last 15 years (98\% of projects report start or end dates between 1991 and 2005) in the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. Data sources included federal, state, local, nongovernmental organization, and tribal contributors. The process of database production identified difficulties in the design of regional project tracking systems. The technical design issues range from low-level information such as what defines a project or a location to high-level issues that include data validation and legalities of interagency data sharing. The completed database will inform efficient monitoring design, effectiveness assessments, and restoration project planning.},
