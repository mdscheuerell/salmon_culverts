# salmon_culverts
A project aiming to improve the use of cost models in culvert improvement planning for salmon fish passage.

Reports can be viewed [here](vandeynze.github.io/salmon_culverts/).

## Repository Structure
- /R/: R scripts used in analysis and building data and models. This subdirectory is divided into "modules" that build upon each other sequentially.
- /data/: Raw data inputs. Please do not modify. May be updated by data pulls as part of building the repository.
- /docs/: Files for report hosting [here](vandeynze.github.io/salmon_culverts/).
- /old/: Deprecated files slated for removal or retained for archival purposes.
- /output/: Objects (figures, maps, intermediate datasets, etc.) generated by scripts in /R/.
- /analysis/: Markdown files and script to build and deploy reports.

## Use
1. Download full repository.  
2. Explore "output" directory for intermediate data products, figures, etc.  
3. To re-build the full analysis...  
   1. Ensure all libraries are properly installed.  
   2. Run scripts in "R" subdirectory modules A-C in numerical order. Some scripts will perform one-time downloads and installs of various files too big to host on GitHub.  
   *Note:* There are dependencies between modules, so be sure to run at least modules A and B in order to completion before attempting to use module C.  
   3. Run _build.R script in the /analysis/ folder to build reports.  

## Key Files
- /output/culverts_full_mapping.csv: These data contain the coordinates for every work site for projects with culvert-related actions between 1996 and 2015. These data should be used as the core inputs into the "C.culvertsspatial" module. Variable definitions can be found in /docs/culverts_full_mapping_metadata.txt.
- /data/PNSHP_raw.csv: These data are from the original PNSHP database pull and serve as the raw data. Please do not modify.
