# salmon_culverts
A project aiming to improve the use of cost models in culvert improvement planning for salmon fish passage.

## Repository Structure
- /R/: R scripts used for building output (other than .Rmd output, which is built directly from the /output/ directory). This subdirectory is divided into "modules" that build upon each other sequentially.
- /data/: Raw data inputs. Please do not modify.
- /docs/: Documentation not generated from scripts.
- /old/: Deprecated files slated for removal or retained for archival purposes.
- /output/: Objects (figures, maps, intermediate datasets, etc.) generated by scripts in /R/.

## Use
1. Download full repository.  
2. Explore "output" directory for intermediate data products, figures, and reports.  
3. To re-build the "output" folder...  
   1. Ensure all libraries are properly installed.  
   2. Run scripts in "R" subdirectory modules A-C in numerical order.  
   *Note:* There are dependencies between modules, so be sure to run at least modules A and B in order to completion before attempting to use module C.  
   3. Knit Rmd scripts in "output" subdirectory for HTML reports.  

## Key Files
- /output/culverts_full_mapping.csv: These data contain the coordinates for every work site for projects with culvert-related actions between 1996 and 2015. These data should be used as the core inputs into the "C.culvertsspatial" module. Variable definitions can be found in /docs/culverts_full_mapping_metadata.txt.
- /data/PNSHP_raw.csv: These data are from the original PNSHP database pull and serve as the raw data. Please do not modify.
